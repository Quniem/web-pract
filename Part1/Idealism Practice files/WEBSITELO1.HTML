<b>Reverse</b>

If you ever find
yourself, somewhere
lost and surrounded
by enemies.

Sway the other way.
They will brainwash you until you mind has drowned with lies.
and explain how your perfection aint shit.

chain changing it up all the time feeling anxiety on the rise.

on the rise.
upcoming...
 
Everyone speaks. 
No one seems to observe and listen.
listening is blinds to the ignorant.
The ignorant always states that he/she understands your knowledge and tries to relate to you..but when you speak on something rational to them ..they throw you down like a bat hitting a curved ball...

swinging at your words to get them as far aways as possible...

making your height feel tramatic..........

   â€¦..and shit..
